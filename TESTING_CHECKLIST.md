# NFC Collection - Final Testing Checklist

## Pre-Merge Verification

### ✅ Code Quality
- [x] No TODOs, FIXMEs, or incomplete code paths in production code
- [x] All temporary test scripts removed
- [x] Consistent code style maintained
- [x] No unnecessary comments

### ✅ Server Architecture
- [x] Unified server (`server.py`) combines WebSocket, NFC, and LED functionality
- [x] Proper singleton pattern for LED controller using `get_led_controller()`
- [x] All Socket.IO event handlers match main branch patterns:
  - `led_update` with command-based structure
  - `led_brightness` for brightness control
  - `visualization_control` for visualization management
  - `register_tag_start/cancel` for NFC registration
  - `ping/pong` for connection health
- [x] LED mode manager properly initialized with status callback
- [x] NFC handler supports both SPI (primary) and I2C (fallback)

### ✅ Configuration
- [x] `config.py` provides NFCConfig dataclass
- [x] Environment variables properly used:
  - `PORT` for server port (default 8000)
  - `NFC_MOCK_MODE` for hardware simulation
  - `LED_BRIGHTNESS` for LED intensity
- [x] Systemd service updated to use `server.py`

### ✅ Documentation
- [x] README.md updated with:
  - Unified server architecture diagram
  - Correct port (8000)
  - Correct LED dimensions (20x5)
  - SPI connection for NFC
- [x] DEPLOYMENT.md updated with:
  - Single service management (`nfc-server`)
  - SPI/I2C configuration
  - Correct troubleshooting steps

### ✅ File Structure
- [x] Removed temporary scripts:
  - `fix-service.sh`
  - `check-service.sh`
  - `setup-nginx.sh`
- [x] `server_clean.py` renamed to `server.py`
- [x] All imports resolved

## Manual Testing Required (On Hardware)

### WebSocket Communication
- [ ] Frontend connects to server on port 8000
- [ ] Real-time bidirectional communication works
- [ ] Connection recovery after network interruption

### NFC Functionality
- [ ] Tags are detected when placed on reader
- [ ] Entry IDs are correctly read from NDEF data
- [ ] Tag registration writes data successfully
- [ ] Proper debouncing (3-second delay)

### LED Integration
- [ ] Interactive mode:
  - [ ] LED updates when entries selected
  - [ ] Correct colors for entry types
  - [ ] Clear all function works
- [ ] Visualization mode:
  - [ ] Patterns animate correctly
  - [ ] Mode switching works
  - [ ] Pause/resume functions
- [ ] Brightness control adjusts intensity
- [ ] LEDs turn off on server shutdown

### Service Management
- [ ] `sudo systemctl start nfc-server` starts successfully
- [ ] `sudo systemctl stop nfc-server` stops cleanly
- [ ] Auto-restart on failure works
- [ ] Logs are properly captured in journald

### Performance
- [ ] No memory leaks during extended operation
- [ ] CPU usage remains reasonable
- [ ] WebSocket messages have low latency
- [ ] LED updates are smooth

## Deployment Validation

### Initial Setup
- [ ] `setup-pi.sh` script completes without errors
- [ ] All dependencies install correctly
- [ ] SPI and I2C are properly enabled

### Production Deployment
- [ ] `deploy.sh` script works from development machine
- [ ] React build deploys successfully
- [ ] nginx properly serves static files
- [ ] nginx proxies WebSocket to port 8000

## Known Working State

The refactored server maintains all functionality from the main branch while consolidating multiple services into a single unified server. The key improvements are:

1. **Simplified architecture**: One server instead of separate WebSocket and NFC services
2. **Better error handling**: Graceful fallback from SPI to I2C for NFC
3. **Cleaner code organization**: Event handlers properly structured
4. **Improved maintainability**: Single service to manage

## Ready for Merge

All automated checks pass. Manual hardware testing should confirm:
- LED visualization responds to frontend commands
- NFC tags are properly detected and registered
- System remains stable under normal operation

The refactored server is ready to merge to main branch once hardware testing confirms functionality.
