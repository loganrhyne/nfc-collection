# Touch Scrolling Fix for Vertical Timeline

## Problem
The vertical timeline in the React app only allowed scrolling via the scrollbar. Attempting to touch and drag on the timeline list would instead select/highlight text, making the interface difficult to use on touchscreens.

## Solution
Applied CSS properties to enable touch scrolling while preventing text selection on scrollable containers, but allowing selective text selection on important content.

## Changes Made

### 1. DashboardLayout.js - RightColumn
Added touch scrolling properties to the right column that contains the timeline in dashboard view:
- `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch` - Enables smooth scrolling on iOS
- `overscroll-behavior: contain` - Prevents scroll chaining
- `touch-action: pan-y` - Enables vertical panning gestures
- `user-select: none` (with vendor prefixes) - Prevents text selection on the container

### 2. EntryView.js - ScrollableTimelineContainer
Added the same touch scrolling properties to the timeline container in the entry detail view.

### 3. VerticalTimeline.js - Selective Text Selection
Enabled text selection on specific content that users might want to copy:
- `TimelineDate` - Users can select and copy dates
- `TimelineType` - Users can select and copy entry types
- `TimelineTitle` - Users can select and copy titles (already enabled)
- `TimelineLocation` - Users can select and copy locations (already enabled)

## Technical Details

The solution works by:
1. Disabling text selection on the scrollable container level
2. Re-enabling text selection on specific child elements that contain copyable content
3. Using `touch-action: pan-y` to explicitly allow vertical touch panning
4. Using `-webkit-overflow-scrolling: touch` for momentum scrolling on iOS devices

## Browser Compatibility
The solution includes vendor prefixes for maximum compatibility:
- `-webkit-` prefixes for Safari/iOS
- `-moz-` prefixes for older Firefox
- `-ms-` prefixes for Internet Explorer/Edge
- Standard properties for modern browsers

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Open the app on a touchscreen device
2. Navigate to the vertical timeline (either in dashboard or entry view)
3. Touch and drag vertically on the timeline - it should scroll smoothly
4. Try to select text by tapping and holding on dates, titles, or locations - selection should work
5. Try to select text on empty areas of timeline cards - selection should be prevented
