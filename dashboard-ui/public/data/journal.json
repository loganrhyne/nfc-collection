  "text" : "# Ras al Jinz Turtle Reserve, Oman\nHeading further south, we found lunch at a locals southeast asian spot \\- a large portion of the immigrant population in Oman are from that region \\- and stopped briefly at the port of Sur, where a quayside exhibit and museum overviewed the history of dhow construction, the distinctive boat of Omani coast\\. We hoped to make the evening turtle tour at our evening destination, so pushed on to the easternmost region, largely empty except for the eco\\-lodges catering to visitors to the turtle beaches\\.\n\nThe sandy pocket beaches on this stretch of coast are completely dominated by sea turtle nests, where it’s estimated that over 30,000 turtles nest annually\\. That evening we took a tour of one of the beaches where we were invited to handle a just\\-hatched turtle \\- my memory is fuzzy but I seem to recall the one we actually found was by a streetlight in town \\- they’re attracted to the lights \\- and the guide wasn’t interested in taking them back to the sea\\. Problematic\\.\n\nThe next morning we returned to the beach in the daylight and while there weren’t any turtles present, the beach was completely transformed by the work if generations of turtle moms building their nests\\.\n\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/48658DB1EF6E4D15AF8F2B93FC397131)\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/D6012454FA274F6FAA9241654FA5317C)\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/F5679130EE18413A9E90B5DC687F82F2)",

  "text" : "# Wahiba Sands, Bidya, Oman\nFrom the turtle beaches we followed the coast as it turned southwards and then made a right angle to head into the Omani interior to dip our toes into the margin of the proper desert.\n\nThe scale is numbing - we spent half an hour driving in to the one of the many desert camps just outside of Bidyah, where the Wahiba Sands abruptly form their northeastern margin. Playing with a satellite view, the long ridges of the dunes run on for miles and miles; and then with a further zoom out, the paltry tidy domain of the Wahiba Sands is dwarfed by the Rub al-khali, the Empty Quarter, starting on Oman’s eastern margin.\n\nWe did find ourselves made comfortable in canvas tents spread out with Persian rugs and served tasty local dishes of slow cooked and well-seasoned meats. Helen and I resolved to summit the nearest dune for sunset and play at sand sledding. The smooth, wind-tumbled sand was as fine as flour and would have been soul crushing if one were to have any aspirations of moving through the landscape one foot. From the top the view was an infinite recursion of ripples both over the distance to the horizon and downwards in scale from the massive dunes themselves to the smallest wind patterning the sand surface at our feet. We slid down in full silliness.\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/28FBEFFB289A4C13BEE7AF139D3D249B)\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/9EF671B9A7684646A9F748C81F037C5F)\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/EA7D0BC85E3F415DA3727F6BBA959EE5)\n![](dayone-moment:\/video\/A12C2E4813704B98B50C7A49A8E71B42)\n![](dayone-moment:\/video\/BA2A24A5A4614FFD9894F921BA4D77EE)\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/A3A89E4390BA4828879475EF3D979C15)\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/C99213E1A0044D9D9F00C3AF141F89A1)\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/17E5FEBC11034205BD1DE2E39E86F7CA)\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/FD908B2CF4A94DABB45C372595317B4A)\n",

In DC I’d played two seasons with the DC Breeze in the AUDL and after moving to CA, which was right around this time, I tried out for the San Jose Spiders and didn’t make the team\\.\n\nIn retrospect I’m happy to have turned to other hobbies \\- I put together a garage workshop and got back into making art; and I picked up road cycling and a bit of mountain biking and took advantage of our peninsula location on two wheel\\. I occasionally miss the camaraderie of being on a team and the “spirit” of ultimate was mostly a real thing, but I haven’t missed the performative competitiveness of elite amateur sport and have enjoyed having my time to my own discretion\\. \n\nI think I’d feel differently if I’d lost my connection to “physicality” and my own body when stepping away from my primary sport of a decade, but it turns out that staying relatively fit and healthy and in touch with my body’s desire to move athletically seem to be quite intrinsic and something I’ve found many other outlets for over the years\\.",

Have been back several times since, always for a wonderful, relaxing weekend\\.\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/546C8171ACA14A5EBCA0158D05831BC8)\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/CE87C9DD2DED44B48FC8DE2C9C2A5438)\n\nPostscript \\(29\/10\/2024\\) \\- [Maddie Evans](https:\/\/www.instagram.com\/mkevans171?igsh=MTdiejFnYXhxM2tkZw==) has been a best friend of Helen’s since St\\. Paul’s and her family’s house in Quogue \\- which her dad bought with a friend back when they were young \\- has been a retreat for her during the summer all her life\\. Helen’s been going since high school and I’ve made the trip a handful of times, including once on the infamous jitney bus \\- for lazy days reading in the front room and lounging at the beach club and eating much too much peach cream pie\\.\n\nMaddie married Alec a few years back \\- Helen was a maid of honor at a beautiful wedding at the New York Botanical Garden in the Bronx \\- and have a son William in the fall of 2023\\. We’re looking forward to many many more summers of  watching William and Lou grow up at the beach\\.\n\nOur last trip was August of 2022 when Gil came out and rented a room at a motel nearby\\. We had a big shrimp dinner one night and chartered a captain for a quite unsuccessful afternoon fishing in Shinnecock Bay, where Helen made the only notable catch\\.\n\nPostscript \\(28\/06\/2025\\) \\- Found this [shared album](https:\/\/photos.app.goo.gl\/Jf4mPzqz1C4or1JD3)  from a classic iteration of the Quogue with Maddie and Alec, Carrie and Nolan, and Alex Sweet from 2017\\. Also Maddie and Alec just had kid #2\\!\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/0AB8C87E6FB14160B098FE25069AC8EB)\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/6297D4FA6FB24A98A7A41893295CC9AD)",

  "text" : "# Ajui, Fuerteventura, SP\nThe arrival for the yurt\\-and\\-yoga retreat was Friday afternoon, so we had the morning to sample the buffet at the resort and take in a round of mini\\-golf before putting our micro\\-rental car through it’s first paces\\. We decided on Ajui \\- a black\\-sand beach harbor 45 minutes across the island with a single fish shack restaurant and promising hike\\.\n\nBoth delivered \\- a memorable blackened fish dish, a dip in the ocean at the corner of the beach, and a hike along the coastal cliffs to the eponymous caves, where some bolted ladders give access to explore the impressive depths\\.\n\nSo far Fuertaventura was giving some mixed signals \\- on one hand, I think we’d both envisioned more “lush island” less “desert rock”; on the other, the village was cute, the scenery was impressive, and the crowds were modest\\. Things got more interesting as soon as we arrived at the Ki Yoga retreat and were welcomed by Alexandra and Boris\\.\n\nWe’d corresponded over email and WhatsApp and arrived with an expectation of a “semi\\-private” retreat: no one else had signed up for our dates\\. At this point we were practicing several mornings a week and, while no means advanced, felt excited about the chance to push a bit deeper with some dedicated time and guidance\\. Alexandra and Boris were super welcoming on arrival to their modest, but tidy home which was, as promised, in the middle of nowhere down a series of dusty gravel roads\\. They showed us to our yurt and the yoga area \\(surprisingly small\\) and then offered tea and we sat and chatted in their cozy living room\\.\n\nThis is when the unexpected \\(to us\\) member of our hereto forward assumed to be private yoga retreat arrived, hoisting a full sized checked luggage bag into the small room and, sweating profusely, made themselves known\\. The vibe seemed a bit off and it wasn’t \\(and was never\\) clear what circumstances transpired to bring this person to this place\\.\n\nWe had our first session together before dinner and that was where we discovered that our 3rd member was, despite his attention otherwise upon arrival, familiar with yoga in theory or practice\\. Our hopes of smooth flows and opportunities to learn from our instructors were quickly abandoned as *both* our guides spent the session try to coach, cajole, and prod our recalcitrant fellow into some semblance of one pose after the next\\.\n\nTo be quite honest, this is the last somewhat clear memory I have of any aspect of the yoga portion of this trip\\. I guess we practiced some the next two days, but what I remember now, six years on, is the road\\-tripping and beach wandering with Helen along dusty, rutted coasted double track\\.\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/video\/6775E742D111461EA9B01FF2CBEE4FF0)\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/18193EE721AC47D0A032D9877EA7037D)\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/E8716C7F45C2405AA2D63CB15A40A986)\n\n \n\n\/\/ drafted July 19, 2025\n",

  "text" : "# Capotaormina, Sicily, IT\nAfter failing to make a Christmas trip happen between Helen’s pregnancy and Gil’s health and obligations in Billings, we instead planned an Easter holiday in Sicily, where it was relatively easy to fly direct from Geneva and where Gil could get back in relatively few hops\\.\n\nSimilar to Oman, I ended up in charge of most of the itinerary and there was quite a bit to balance; Helen needed to work the first few days and we wanted a “soft” landing, but we also didn’t want to just sit on the beach exclusively and anyways, the resorts catering to that kind of vacation were on the north coast, and the direct flights from Geneva arrived in Catania in the southeast side\\.\n\nTaormina, a destination town since the Roman era, caught our eye as a possibility, however instead of being on the coast, the town was nestled several hundred meters up the rocky cliffs, where it commanded magnificent views, but obviously didn’t provide much of a beach\\-y atmosphere\\. We ended up booking at the Capotaormina Hotel, which was every bit the Bond\\-villain bunker base it seemed in the pictures\\. The entrance to the hotel is at ground level at the top of the cliffs and the hotel follows the steep terraced sides down 6 levels, where each room commands views out over the Mediterranean\\. Then the elevator shaft sinks another hundred or more feet down through the bedrock to connect to an artificial cave that opens on one side to a private pocket beach and at the long end to an infinity pool and oceanside restaurant perched at the very tip of the cape\\.\n\nThe arrival process was so frustrating it was comical \\- Gil spent the better part of 20 minutes “arguing” to try to get a better room and I, in embarrassment, and Helen, in tiredness, stepped aside and waited on a bench until they’d concluded\\. Then they took us to our room, which was in an annex wing and far from the central restaurant and main elevator \\- plus had a poorer view \\- and we trekked back to the desk to rehash the same discussion that Gil had until they put us in the room next to him\\. For all my reticence, this really paid off \\- the view now included Mount Etna in the distance and we were just around the corner from the elevator to the beach\\. My strong sense of conflict aversion, while great for a “easy going” vibe, does let me down in situations where a little less “satisficing” does indeed result in a better outcome for little cost\\.\n\nThe hotel provided a shuttle up the spectacular winding road to Taormina proper, which we made our way to for dinner on the second night at a cute little restaurant right by the eastern gate of the Main Street\\. We took a short wander, but the crowds and timing led us to quickly hurry back with only fleeting impressions\\. We returned the next day to make a more concerted effort and checked out the Roman amphitheater, which was truly awe\\-inspiring in its scale and location, perched on an outcrop with commanding views of town, the backing hills, and the full sweep of the rocky headlands and sweeping bays chasing around the island\\. Town itself was beautiful in that classically Italian “we once were mighty” shabbiness, but unfortunately the high street was largely “generic tourist shopping experience” with Italian trappings\\. And it was crowded\\.\n\nThe Roman history, architecture, and food did make it memorable \\- the central square echoed the view from the amphitheater and the grand hotels and solid stone buildings were timeless in a way that evokes a nostalgia for a time we never lived in\\. We were treated to perfect Mediterranean weather and enjoyed a few delicious if unmemorable\\-in\\-their\\-specifics meals\\.\n\nTo be honest, my favorite aspect was the hotel; I’m glad in retrospect that I stuck to my intuition and booked us there\\. The pocket beach felt like a secret garden and something about the elevator\\-into\\-a\\-cave was just so comic\\-book\\-childish that I had a huge grin on my face every time the doors opened\\.\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/video\/3491DB1D9E794D7C8051EB14ADE64AAF)\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/8927C59FEB2D4971981A3FBF7761973D)\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/7CAF58E91B5841B4AB7FD19A486C8D7B)\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/1042761956E642C89096F9D8330CF33D)\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/A7AFED623B554C2691B891832DF58CE9)\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/AD4FAE89A58E4BF995A0402AC413F00E)\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/D152A558FD2248099B68764C49697FE3)",

My strong sense of conflict aversion, while great for a “easy going” vibe, does let me down in situations where a little less “satisficing” does indeed result in a better outcome for little cost.\\n\"},{\"attributes\":{\"line\":{\"header\":0,\"identifier\":\"40E402DC-F851-44ED-9C18-5BF8D2EC5DBB\"}},\"text\":\"\\n\"},{\"attributes\":{\"line\":{\"header\":0,\"identifier\":\"ADAC3949-47C4-48FD-B115-AA43F197717F\"}},\"text\":\"The hotel provided a shuttle up the spectacular winding road to Taormina proper, which we made our way to for dinner on the second night at a cute little restaurant right by the eastern gate of the Main Street. We took a short wander, but the crowds and timing led us to quickly hurry back with only fleeting impressions. We returned the next day to make a more concerted effort and checked out the Roman amphitheater, which was truly awe-inspiring in its scale and location, perched on an outcrop with commanding views of town, the backing hills, and the full sweep of the rocky headlands and sweeping bays chasing around the island. Town itself was beautiful in that classically Italian “we once were mighty” shabbiness, but unfortunately the high street was largely “generic tourist shopping experience” with Italian trappings.

  "text" : "# Catania, Sicily, IT\nFrom Taormina, we drove south through the rolling hills flanking Mount Etna and skirted Catania, then followed the coast through a surprising heavy industrial zone where long piers stretched half a kilometer into the the bay to connect tankers to the processing facilities\\. I’ve always been fascinated by the dense, intricacies of refineries and chemical plants \\- something about all the bare functionality exposed in twisting layers of of overlapping pipes and cooling towers and the unabashed verticality and the tension between the spindly, reaching forms and dark solid metal is appealing\\. It was also completely unexpected in a place otherwise bookended by ancient history and natural beauty to confront the monstrous, generic forms of our global industrial age\\.\n\nWe came down into Syracuse and found our little hotel on the landward side just a few blocks shy of the island that defines the historic city\\. We ended up largely occupying ourselves with finding food and drink for the 36 hours we spent in the city, but in the process walked the majority of the island and left by driving the narrow \\- even for European standards \\- road following the island’s periphery\\. In reflection there are only vignettes of Syracuse \\- the bustling market that seemed a true mix of tourists and locals shopping for dinner; the over\\-piled seafood platter served ever\\-so\\-slowly and ever\\-so\\-warmly at a little side\\-street restaurant; a brunch spot tucked into a tiny square that revealed itself unexpectedly stepping off an otherwise bland block of apartments\\. I feel we missed out on experiencing the “bones” of Syracuse \\- over the centuries the Greek, Roman, Byzantine, Arab, Norman, and Spanish all took turns holding sway over the ancient port and there are sites where that history can be felt first hand\\. Unfortunately this was not that trip and our surface level wandering was pleasant enough, but left us ready to move on\\.\n\nAfter a somehow unmemorable backroads drive through the countryside \\- I think largely because it was a race to get to somewhere I could take a somewhat important work call \\- we piled into Catania expecting to spend a day and a night in place before making our way to the airport\\. Instead I found it to be the most compelling part of our visit, largely due to it remaining a more or less “real” place, where the palimpsest of history poked through in jarring ways in the scruffy modernity of Italy’s quiescence\\. In mucking out to reinforce the facade of the cathedral, an ancient roman bathhouse was discovered and the springs still flow water through the channels millennia later\\. Inside the Cathedral, the death mask of Blessed Cardinal Giuseppe Benedetto Dusmet in patinated silver and the teeming, organic effluvia of the rood screens, evoked than the Conjoiners from Reqynold’s Revelation Space, and the opera house simply felt stuck in time\\.\n\nIn the morning the fish market lived up to its billing \\- again teeming with as many \\(or more\\) lookers than buyers \\- but at least a plausible facsimile of what must have been happening for centuries\\. And then I ended our time taking a solo excursion out of the central area through some rougher residential streets to get to the unexpectedly apocalyptic beachfront \\- the former heyday of Italian economic and tourist might has clearly waned and what’s left \\- at least on a cool spring evening \\- were pockets of teenagers smoking at the end of splintery, makeshift boardwalks against a backdrop of abandoned water slides and crumbling restaurants\\. Mount Etna smoked and heavy industry ships cruised slowly in and out of the harbor to add to an appropriate tone in the far background\\.\n\nThe next morning we flew out early, leaving Gil to make his own way home to Montana\\. I enjoy these trips we take with the three of us, though they don’t come without their tradeoffs and I feel that some Sicily has much more to offer were one to travel more lightly and with more spontaneity than we could muster for this endeavor\\.\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/E99056B2FECE40EEAEF6399A49629726)\n\n*Catania sunrise from the hotel window before heading to the airport\\.*\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/911C7149403C468DB7C2DAC57A649441)\n\n*Aetna smoking forms the backdrop of the “Playa” beach in Catania \\(above\\)*\n\n*Scenes from the Catania Cathedral and Roman Baths a the adjacent fish market and opera house in Catania\\. \\(Below\\)*\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/DD8B0938E24F475087AAB15898FCAE97)\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/1805DB65FC334361ACDD2CC248349DAE)\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/AF71158830614D079A563D6E874CDEDE)\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/3541E4B8CE46421FAAE2CA7493A5D0C5)\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/CCE57DC0FF0947B7A05697430B5177C3)\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/FCB3FB45E3F2472581C1E90022E0A7C2)\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/EC0E0BAF627349109BB6752C1AA068D1)\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/2BB7AC1FB4104188A983646BBA71D1FA)\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/2DDF117827B54042B1DE4C7DD5FC3C75)\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/61F998B63B5547089768281614BAF527)\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/C69846A9ECE047F99FBDE9689E000325)\n\n*Snapshots from Syracuse*",

  "text" : "# Morteratsch, Pontresina, CH\nOur 4th Engadin Ski Marathon weekend. Last year Helen completed an abridged half with Lou as a passenger; this year she hung with me for a little morning exploration up the valley while Helen ski’d a “full” half. This ended up being a great weekend and a bit of a proving ground for taking this iteration of the circus in the road. I only: fed Lou sugary pancakes at breakfast (twice); didn’t bundle her enough for hiking up a glacier valley before the sun was shining; and something else I’ve already forgotten. Upon reflection I identified that my very deep seated drive to do things quickly and “efficiently” while accepting compromises or shifted risk balance no longer serves as the appropriate heuristic for success in fatherhood. I think I need to slow way down; take time to stop; time to double-back for a forgotten item; time to reflect and consider contingencies; time to be present and in a particular moment.\n\nLou, for her part, was an absolute champ excepting her ongoing sleep struggles. She had a solid first pool outing, which concluded without tears. And made it though a cumulative 14 hours of train travel with only one significant soothing-to-sleep episode in each direction. She’s just the best.\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/B76BDF5F68F24E60856281A0EB1CF986)\n![](dayone-moment:\/video\/E24B9482A5094A71B31A7A7D7E6ED973)\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/8A8CE5CF0CF1496E970D43AD8D4C20E5)\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/F2C611475C1F44159390CD229CD4C15F)\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/1C3561CAC4444B36931DD0AC9351967C)\n",

Spend Saturday road tripping to Valais where we tried (unsuccessfully and through a series of preventable-but-unfortunate errors of timing and judgement) three times to find Kaitlynn along her 50km of the VTSB marathon course before giving up and driving to our shared campsite at Bourg-Saint-Pierre. There we snacked on our eclectic assortment from the bio store and saw snatches of a junior traveling circus perform with a seriousness of purpose and self-aware artistry that read as appropriately French.\n\nKaitlynn made it around as Helen and I took turns trying to get Lou down in her little travel bassinet in our ridiculous inflatable tent. Paul arrived shortly after having biked around from Verbier. I think I hadn’t seen them since a brief catch up at the Priory Tavern in Kilburn around the corner from their house some 18 months ago, just after we found out Lou was coming and I was weaving baskets on a course with my mom at West Dean.\n\nThere’s a picture in the album from 5am the next morning that better captures how this night went than a narrative, but we still managed to bundle ourselves up and get in the car and up the road to the Saint Grand Bernard pass before 9am. Some faff with the dog and the pack and diapers and we were walking into an ominous misty morning by 9:35 in high spirits, even if I was privately harboring some doubts about the weight of the pack as I mentally climbed the three high passes called for in the full version of the loop I’d mapped out.\n\nAfter the interruptions of getting started - a quick in-pack snack for Lou; a poop pickup for Wapi; a course correction from the exposed balcony approach to the fall-line trail - we set our pace and moved steadily up against the flowing streams carrying down all of winter’s hard work moving water to high places. Lou kept up a babble to match brook switching between her current conlang of sing-song doo-pee-doo’s and quite clear imperatives of “up up up” which was a welcome motivation and distraction from distressingly plodding legs as we clawed our way up the 400 meters to the pass at the Fenetre de Ferre and caught our breath as the lifted clouds revealed the names Lacs de Fenetre dripped down the opposing valley.\n\nWe started down to get out of the wind and find a flat spot for a snack, but by the time we’d reached the plateau above the first lake, Lou was asleep. We’d made decent time and folks were enthusiastic for the scenery of the remaining route, so we opted to push on, much to the chagrin of my already-heavy legs. But it was fulfilling to see everyone (Wapi included) so pleased with my route selection and I felt a bit of (self-imposed) pressure to live up to a self-image of a fit and capable father-athlete: so on we went.\n\nAt the base of the lake the outflow disappeared abruptly into a dramatic cave (though the map promises it emerges right below, so perhaps simply under an exceptionally large boulder) and we traced the dramatic relief to the right as we started up the boulder field to Col du Bastillon. Here Helen’s kind insistence met my anxious fatigue and I borrowed her hiking poles (having set out with only one as my other was broken a few seasons back) and quickly found that using both reduced the strain on the small muscles stabilizing the rolling sway, which is what torched my glute meds on the first climb. Steadily, and with growing optimism for a non-catastrophic result, Lou and I brought up the rear behind Wapi scouting a switchback ahead and Helen, Kaitlynn, and Paul keeping up a background chatter of conversation. Lou woke up just in time to appreciate the clever bit of trail building tucked right into the cliff to bring us to the pass. Definitely more exposure than preferred and one section with a few steps across fresher slips, but overall well set for a sure footed traverse into the much less trod upper reaches of the Combe de Drone.\n\nWe thought about lunch-with-a-view from the pass, but Helen thought better for Lou to have some safe crawl around space. In my enthusiasm, and Lou’s increasingly urgent fussing to come out of the pack, and Wapi’s hunting about for water, I pulled away from the group and made the decision for all to head to a grassy spot by a high lake. Wapi dove right into to cool off and drink his fill and Lou happily popped out of the pack ready for lunch - she’d been in happily for over three hours!\n\nOminous clouds and a cold wind joined us halfway though snacks and added a level of urgency to our departure, though by the time we took to the trail again the sun and wind were back in our favor and we chatted happily as we slipped down the valley to find our the start of our final effort to Pas de Chevaux, which would bring us back in high above the Combe des Morts and the namesake hospice and auberge where we started hours earlier. This climb, though only 300m, tested me (and Lou as well as she fought successfully against a nap the whole time - later determined to be cold toes and legs) but it was over relatively quickly and we celebrated the completion of our elevation gain with some tablet that Paul had brought along.\n\nI again set a downhill pace excited to get Lou off my back. Paul indulged me a monologue on various Palantir topics during which the final kilometers rolled by. We flopped out just below the pass around 3:30, just as the first raindrops fell and felt lucky to not only have avoided the rain, but also to have set quite a respectable pace for the 12km, +\/-1000m loop. Lou’s enjoyment substantially raised our enthusiasm for additional summer outings and Helen shared that it was a great reminder of how much she liked hiking - I’m really looking forward to taking as much advantage as possible of this little window where Lou is small enough (and my legs are strong enough) to have more mountain adventures in this format.\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/B5FB5B25BE484D3E8ADB6F3C9AAF0723)\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/A3BAF8A235254C18B9F32D1523DC46A0)\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/A3C30B4274584F96B88F46753C27DDE0)\n\n",

Spend Saturday road tripping to Valais where we tried (unsuccessfully and through a series of preventable-but-unfortunate errors of timing and judgement) three times to find Kaitlynn along her 50km of the VTSB marathon course before giving up and driving to our shared campsite at Bourg-Saint-Pierre. There we snacked on our eclectic assortment from the bio store and saw snatches of a junior traveling circus perform with a seriousness of purpose and self-aware artistry that read as appropriately French.\\n\\n\"},{\"attributes\":{},\"text\":\"Kaitlynn made it around as Helen and I took turns trying to get Lou down in her little travel bassinet in our ridiculous inflatable tent. Paul arrived shortly after having biked around from Verbier. I think I hadn’t seen them since a brief catch up at the Priory Tavern in Kilburn around the corner from their house some 18 months ago, just after we found out Lou was coming and I was weaving baskets on a course with my mom at West Dean.\\n\\n\"},{\"attributes\":{},\"text\":\"There’s a picture in the album from 5am the next morning that better captures how this night went than a narrative, but we still managed to bundle ourselves up and get in the car and up the road to the Saint Grand Bernard pass before 9am. Some faff with the dog and the pack and diapers and we were walking into an ominous misty morning by 9:35 in high spirits, even if I was privately harboring some doubts about the weight of the pack as I mentally climbed the three high passes called for in the full version of the loop I’d mapped out.\\n\\n\"},{\"attributes\":{},\"text\":\"After the interruptions of getting started - a quick in-pack snack for Lou; a poop pickup for Wapi; a course correction from the exposed balcony approach to the fall-line trail - we set our pace and moved steadily up against the flowing streams carrying down all of winter’s hard work moving water to high places. Lou kept up a babble to match brook switching between her current conlang of sing-song doo-pee-doo’s and quite clear imperatives of “up up up” which was a welcome motivation and distraction from distressingly plodding legs as we clawed our way up the 400 meters to the pass at the Fenetre de Ferre and caught our breath as the lifted clouds revealed the names Lacs de Fenetre dripped down the opposing valley.\\n\\n\"},{\"attributes\":{},\"text\":\"We started down to get out of the wind and find a flat spot for a snack, but by the time we’d reached the plateau above the first lake, Lou was asleep. We’d made decent time and folks were enthusiastic for the scenery of the remaining route, so we opted to push on, much to the chagrin of my already-heavy legs. But it was fulfilling to see everyone (Wapi included) so pleased with my route selection and I felt a bit of (self-imposed) pressure to live up to a self-image of a fit and capable father-athlete: so on we went.\\n\\n\"},{\"attributes\":{},\"text\":\"At the base of the lake the outflow disappeared abruptly into a dramatic cave (though the map promises it emerges right below, so perhaps simply under an exceptionally large boulder) and we traced the dramatic relief to the right as we started up the boulder field to Col du Bastillon. Here Helen’s kind insistence met my anxious fatigue and I borrowed her hiking poles (having set out with only one as my other was broken a few seasons back) and quickly found that using both reduced the strain on the small muscles stabilizing the rolling sway, which is what torched my glute meds on the first climb. Steadily, and with growing optimism for a non-catastrophic result, Lou and I brought up the rear behind Wapi scouting a switchback ahead and Helen, Kaitlynn, and Paul keeping up a background chatter of conversation. Lou woke up just in time to appreciate the clever bit of trail building tucked right into the cliff to bring us to the pass. Definitely more exposure than preferred and one section with a few steps across fresher slips, but overall well set for a sure footed traverse into the much less trod upper reaches of the Combe de Drone.\\n\\n\"},{\"attributes\":{},\"text\":\"We thought about lunch-with-a-view from the pass, but Helen thought better for Lou to have some safe crawl around space. In my enthusiasm, and Lou’s increasingly urgent fussing to come out of the pack, and Wapi’s hunting about for water, I pulled away from the group and made the decision for all to head to a grassy spot by a high lake. Wapi dove right into to cool off and drink his fill and Lou happily popped out of the pack ready for lunch - she’d been in happily for over three hours!\\n\\n\"},{\"attributes\":{},\"text\":\"Ominous clouds and a cold wind joined us halfway though snacks and added a level of urgency to our departure, though by the time we took to the trail again the sun and wind were back in our favor and we chatted happily as we slipped down the valley to find our the start of our final effort to Pas de Chevaux, which would bring us back in high above the Combe des Morts and the namesake hospice and auberge where we started hours earlier. This climb, though only 300m, tested me (and Lou as well as she fought successfully against a nap the whole time - later determined to be cold toes and legs) but it was over relatively quickly and we celebrated the completion of our elevation gain with some tablet that Paul had brought along.\\n\\n\"},{\"attributes\":{},\"text\":\"I again set a downhill pace excited to get Lou off my back. Paul indulged me a monologue on various Palantir topics during which the final kilometers rolled by. We flopped out just below the pass around 3:30, just as the first raindrops fell and felt lucky to not only have avoided the rain, but also to have set quite a respectable pace for the 12km, +\/-1000m loop. Lou’s enjoyment substantially raised our enthusiasm for additional summer outings and Helen shared that it was a great reminder of how much she liked hiking - I’m really looking forward to taking as much advantage as possible of this little window where Lou is small enough (and my legs are strong enough) to have more mountain adventures in this format.\\n\\n\"},{\"embeddedObjects\":[{\"type\":\"photo\",\"identifier\":\"B5FB5B25BE484D3E8ADB6F3C9AAF0723\"},{\"type\":\"photo\",\"identifier\":\"A3BAF8A235254C18B9F32D1523DC46A0\"},{\"type\":\"photo\",\"identifier\":\"A3C30B4274584F96B88F46753C27DDE0\"}]}],\"meta\":{\"created\":{\"platform\":\"com.bloombuilt.dayone-mac\",\"version\":1678},\"small-lines-removed\":true,\"version\":1}}",

Woke up and took Lou after Helen took the ​*early*​ early shift and we had a lovely morning while Helen caught up on some much needed sleep\\. A long walk with Wapi through the fields and back by the bottom of the property where ChatGPT and I speculated about the possibility of adding a barn\/garage\/workshop and whether it would get permitted under Geneva and Meinier approval for agricultural zoned property\\.\n\nWe’d talked about making a day hike, but had also both been battling some interrupted\/deprived sleep for the past week as Lou went through a regression \\(and in retrospect it seems like the start of her transition from two to one naps during the day\\)\\. But we rallied after lunch and piled into the car just beating Lou’s sleep pressure, which gave us two hours to snoop our way through the local neighborhoods to spy on a few houses that had recently come up for sale and then take the backroads winding our way to Sixt\\-Fer\\-A\\-Cheval, which had been on my radar for a long time to explore simply based on looking at the topo map\\.\n\nBut we’d always been more intent on getting up to Chamonix, since we have friends and a place to stay, and it’s the same driving distance, so we’d passed it by until now\\. I’m glad we finally made it\\!\n\nEven from the parking lot the towering walls of the cirque dominated the treelike and waterfalls poured from every crevice\\. The refrain of the hike was calling out all the ways it felt straight out of Hyrule and we spotted several undeniable Korok seed locations\\. Lou did great all things considered and Wapi was thrilled to get a few chances to splash into the cold, clear water as we worked our way upstream on a broad, gravel path with lots of other Sunday walkers\\. We crossed at the second bridge and made our way back under the cliffs and into a wooded section where Lou finally ran out of patience to learning “head”, “shoulder”, “knees”, and “toes” \\(finding and labeling her “ears” was a very cute first on this hike\\) and demanding a trail\\-side snack after which the backpack was strictly off limits\\. We finished the hike with Helen carrying the backpack and other gear and me with Wapi in one hand and Lou on the other hip, adding a hustle step when we hit the parking lot to, for the second hike in a row, make it to the car just as the first raindrops started falling\\.\n\nWe’d been anticipating\/dreading the drive back, since we knew Lou wouldn’t be happy getting back in the car \\(spoiler: she wasn’t\\) so we stopped in Samoens to hunt for anyplace that would feed us at the ungodly early hour of 6pm \\(spoiler: there wasn’t\\)\\. Both turned out to be disguised blessings as \\- after a few laps around town \\-  we begged our way in early to MEZZANINE where we had such kind service \\- they brought a book for Lou and took our orders 15 minutes before they officially opened\\. As we ate all the other families showed up for the early service\\.\n\nLou did some crawling around the cute streets of the old town and we were next to the 16th century bell tower when it told it was 7:30 and time to hit the road\\. Lou fell asleep quick and Helen drove us home through pouring rain while we listened to some bluegrass and chatted about past adventures\\. A bit of a fire drill getting Lou inside with the rain still coming down hard, but we were all snug and warm soon enough\\.\n\nWe’d like to return for a longer adventure and stay a night in a gite or hotel in the valley; the only wrinkle is that Wapi isn’t allowed in the nature preserve the covers most of the valley and all of the higher places\\.\n\n---\n\nThe Sixt\\-Fer\\-à\\-Cheval is the largest limestone cirque in Europe\\. It’s often tough to find a good sandbar this high up in the mountains, but clearly the water has been moving here for eons and continues to erode away the high rocks from all sides\\. The rushing waters of La Giffre \\- which names the valley below \\- have their headwaters only a few kilometers upstream but are already rushing to carry tons of material downstream with enough force to create sand bars of fine black limestone\\.\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/3FEC0BB187FF4FFE92930CCAC275A937)\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/6F2205885D5F4B3D9C3596BB56BB3FD1)\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/C16F22571D20463484A574BEFF093A26)\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/video\/F4586C581E1E4CD28619854347ECF69F)",

We started at the Edderfuglen cafe and nature school, where Lou and Axel warmed up to the baby bunnies before heading to the back for their lunch and a stare\\-off with the goats\\.\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/video\/BBD11E14CDCB4F88B82614F880EDEADC)\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/8BE00214761042DBB11A46E30EC05FC2)\n\nWe walked back down the road and headed  into the rolling meadows between us and the southern coast\\.  With both babies promptly asleep, we rolled the dice on the Bob trailer capability and took ourselves down 20 minutes of steep, rooted track that would be a challenge to climb back up\\. Thankfully we made it down to the beach where Helen bagged this sample and the rest of the path was slightly less adventurous as we regained the bluff and made our way counterclockwise to the lighthouse at the point\\.\n\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/FACBD8E68D084C5CB641644776CE4197)\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/video\/CC1AC73E05994EC498172B66A40A09E9)\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/AFA81F16788840AC9C04F86130F08894)\n\nBy the time we took in the view from the top, changed a diaper on the picnic table, and headed back to the cafe, we were running on fumes and feeling the results of the surprisingly strong sun\\. Our reprieve came in the form of ordering most of the menu \\- the namesake RØSNÆSTOAST sandwich, baba ghanoush, shakshouka, arancini, with homemade lemonade and non\\-alcoholic beers\\. Still hungry we sampled all three of their cakes \\- a fudge chocolate browny, a classic Danish lemon cake with olive oil, and another that already slips my mind\\.  Our table\\-mates had a 13 month old girl as well \\- Lily \\- and we quickly bonded over shared development milestones as Lily and Lou were clearly on the same agenda; they’re also living in Copenhagen and finishing up a renovation on a summer home that is just a kilometer or two from Anne Marie and Anders place\\. Helen managed a bit of internet sleuthing and turns out that the father is the Copenhagen\\-based conductor for the Victoria Symphony in British Columbia, where he spends a couple months of the year\\.\n\nAt this point we were fat and happy and proud of our big day out and ready to head home to get on the bedtime train\\. We still managed a tasty dinner and Anders and I went out for a late evening swim before bed\\.\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/98804AA791A3494498906D04A3FA5D4E)\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/A2FB629BBA3E4DB6AE5BE91C30EAA716)\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/F6B03F9134954454A0474CE0B76FB091)\n\nThere were lots of other highlights from this portion of the trip: swimming with the whole crew down at the harbor; eavesdropping on AM prepping to interview for a position leading an initiative to build a quantum computing facility; catching up with Anders on the Danish energy markets and the progress of his startup; watching Lou proudly climb her way into the high chair on her own; playing Spiderman lottery with August; walking through the oak woods with Helen and Lou\\. Helen’s beautiful cheese boards and apero with Anne Marie’s parents\\.\n\nAnd from back in Copenhagen we managed to catch up with David M\\. twice: for pizza at AM and Anders how the night we arrived and again two evenings later for a delicious meal at Bar’Vin in central Copenhagen, where a colleague of Helen’s \\- who happened to be in town \\- joined for a bit as well\\.\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/D95E1F067F91465F953F2297049DDC33)\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/F52528CD77F44B39998330D17C114B08)",

  "text" : "# Cluny, FR\nShort weekend trip to Burgundy to stay at the home of Antoine and Priscillia, whose parents are neighbors in Carre d’Amont and who recently brought their three boys over for pancakes and again for s’mores\\.\n\nJust a two hour drive from Geneva, Cluny is a very quiet medieval walled town, mostly known for its abbey \\(now in ruins\\) that was the largest church in western Christendom until St Peter’s Basilica in the Vatican was constructed\\.\n\nTheir home is on the main street between a cute bookstore\/coffee shop and a sunglass store; the narrow staircase is an immediate cool, dark transition from the bright, bustling street and at the top of the stairs the view is through the kitchen and adjacent terrace into the park grounds of the monastery\\.\n\nThis morning Helen’s back was still hurting, so Lou and I took off to explore around the old abbey grounds\\. We started at the hippodrome hoping to find some horses to snoop on; they were all the way at the end in a very sunny field\\. We tried Lou’s patience a bit on the way across, but she made her horse lip flutter sound with truly great enthusiasm starting as soon as they were in sight\\.\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/77969B5EA3BB4275ACB112FCC86F2A4E)\n\nFrom there we headed to the main square to check out the abbey grounds themselves\\. Only a tiny portion of the main cathedral remains \\- its bulk was used as a quarry during and immediately after the French revolution\\. As a side note I love this image of historic grandeur and sophistication on a scale such that it can only be used as raw material inputs for a subsequent generation\\. Very much one of my favorite sci\\-fi tropes and incredible to visit a site and explore a history that embodies it\\.\n\nThe museum tour was a bit disconnected as Lou commandeered the audio guide and enjoyed smashing the buttons as it auto played through our rambles\\. There were a few truly sublime moments walking in to the remaining tower, where the full cross\\-section of the Abbey remained in the ceiling soared to 70 m\\. Seeing on the overlay of the original plan, the massive steps that we initially seen in the square as we came around the corner and understanding that they were the entrance at the main doors of the church\\. We made our way through to the \nGrainery, which backs up to the wall being Priscilla’s house\\. So far, Lou had spent the morning in the travel stroller, and I picked her up to carry into the second floor of the greenery, she immediately turned into a sac of potatoes and was dead asleep by the time we got to the recovered capitals arranged at  back of the grainery \\- the stone supports became our nap spot for the next half hour\\. Pretty interesting view to stare at while she slept\\.\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/33CA447536CB42A19E1209BAB9971DF2)\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/29306401A9A448AEA2C5D84669744C2B)\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/E412A8940B8F4E1AB2D9EEA0F302D0C0)\n\nAfter pondering timber framing engineering principles, Lou awoke and we hung out in the shaded grass, smashed a pouch, changed a diaper, and proceeded to a solid independent play session folding and refilling the diaper mat\\. Satisfied, we headed back through the ruins, where I found a little corner of the crumbling masonry from which to sample the mortar, and then on through the square to meet Helen at lunch at Le Cloître, which was Priscillia’s recommendation\\. We keep forgetting how much Lou eats; everything was tasty, including a new\\-to\\-us puffed egg skewer dish, but we left not\\-quite\\-full having given Lou many choice bites for her lunch\\.\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/video\/983AE71CCF534DBE9AFDB50E8171EFFA)\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/929A7D55F39E42CBABADBF80FD62B867)\n\n![](dayone-moment:\/\/1B825C78E5C94183A95F1023590FD83E)\n\nThe rest of the visit had a few other highlights: getting locked out after lunch for 90 minutes only to discover that the keys were in my pocket the whole time; 2\\.5 hours of middle of the night wake window for Lou cause she needed a giant poop; a solid 90 minutes of near\\-dead\\-stop traffic catching us unexpectedly in the drive home\\.\n\n",
