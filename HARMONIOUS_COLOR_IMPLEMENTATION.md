# Harmonious Color Scheme Implementation

## Summary

The Harmonious color palette has been successfully implemented as the new color scheme for the NFC Collection app.

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Color Definitions

**JavaScript** (`dashboard-ui/src/utils/colorSchemeEnhanced.js`):
- Beach: Amber (#E6B877 UI / #FFA028 LED)
- Desert: Coral (#E78A7E UI / #FF5A3C LED)
- Lake: Teal (#80BFC6 UI / #00B4C8 LED)
- Mountain: Sage (#A7C4A0 UI / #50C878 LED)
- River: Indigo (#7A89C2 UI / #5A5AFF LED)
- Ruin: Plum (#B58ABF UI / #B43CDC LED)

**Python** (`python-services/services/led_colors.py`):
- Updated with matching LED RGB values

### 2. Updated All Component Imports

All components now import from `colorSchemeEnhanced.js`:
- ActiveFilters.js
- MapView.js
- EntryView.js
- VerticalTimeline.js
- All chart components
- JournalEntryDetail.js

### 3. Key Improvements

1. **Clear Differentiation**: Desert (Coral) and Mountain (Sage) are now visually distinct
2. **6th Color Added**: Ruin type now has Plum color
3. **Natural Associations**: Each color has a memorable name
4. **LED Optimization**: All colors are vibrant on LEDs

## Deployment

The changes have been built and are ready for deployment. To complete:

```bash
# If deployment timed out, check status on Pi:
ssh loganrhyne@192.168.1.114 "ls -la /home/loganrhyne/nfc-collection/dashboard-ui/build/"

# Or manually deploy:
cd /home/coder/git/nfc-collection
./deploy.sh
```

## Testing

After deployment:
1. Visit http://192.168.1.114/ to see new colors in action
2. Visit http://192.168.1.114/debug to compare color schemes
3. Test LED colors with different entry types

## Rollback

If needed, the original colors are preserved in:
- `/home/coder/git/nfc-collection/dashboard-ui/src/utils/colorScheme.js`
- Original proposal comparisons in debug page
