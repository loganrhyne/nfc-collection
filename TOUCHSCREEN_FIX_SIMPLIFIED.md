# Simplified Touchscreen Scrolling Fix

## Changes Made

### 1. TimelineCard Component
Added CSS properties to prevent text selection while allowing scrolling:
```css
/* Prevent text selection on the card itself */
-webkit-touch-callout: none;
-webkit-user-select: none;
-moz-user-select: none;
-ms-user-select: none;
user-select: none;

/* Touch handling */
touch-action: manipulation; /* Allows scrolling but prevents zoom */
-webkit-tap-highlight-color: rgba(0,0,0,0); /* Remove tap highlight */
```

### 2. Container Inheritance
Added to TimelineContainer to ensure proper touch behavior inheritance:
```css
* {
  -webkit-overflow-scrolling: inherit;
  touch-action: inherit;
}
```

### 3. Parent Containers Already Have
- RightColumn in DashboardLayout.js has full touch scrolling CSS
- ScrollableTimelineContainer in EntryView.js has full touch scrolling CSS

## How It Works
1. Parent containers (RightColumn, ScrollableTimelineContainer) handle scrolling
2. Timeline cards prevent text selection but allow touch-action: manipulation
3. Important text (dates, titles, etc.) can still be selected with user-select: text

## Building
```bash
cd dashboard-ui
./build-with-version.sh "touchscreen-v3"
```

## What This Fixes
- ✅ Prevents text selection when trying to scroll
- ✅ Allows smooth touch scrolling on timeline
- ✅ Maintains tap-to-select functionality
- ✅ Preserves text selection on important content

The key insight: Let the parent container handle scrolling, just prevent text selection on the cards themselves.
