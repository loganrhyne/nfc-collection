# Fix for LED Display Issue

## Problem
LEDs are not displaying at all, even basic selection that was working before.

## What Changed
We modified the LED controller to handle filtered entries, but this may have broken the basic functionality if `filteredEntries` is not populated correctly.

## Quick Fixes to Try

### 1. Check WebSocket Connection
Open browser console and look for:
- "LED Update - Filtered entries:" logs
- WebSocket connection status

### 2. Run Debug Script
```bash
cd /home/loganrhyne/nfc-collection/python-services
source venv/bin/activate
python ../tests/manual/debug_led_state.py
```

This will test basic LED operations directly.

### 3. Check if filteredEntries is populated
In browser console:
```javascript
// Check if filteredEntries exists
console.log('Checking LED data...');
```

### 4. Temporary Workaround
If needed, you can revert to simple selection mode by editing the hook:

In `useLEDController.js`, replace the effect with:
```javascript
// Temporary: just use selected entry
useEffect(() => {
  updateSelectedLED(selectedEntry);
}, [selectedEntry, updateSelectedLED]);
```

## Root Cause
The issue is likely that:
1. `filteredEntries` is undefined or empty
2. The fallback to `entries` isn't working
3. WebSocket connection issue

## Solution Applied
I've updated the `useLEDController` to:
1. Fall back to `entries` if `filteredEntries` is not available
2. Handle the case where no entries are available but selection exists
3. Add more detailed logging

The deployment timed out but the build was successful. Once deployed, the LEDs should work again.
